# Code for analyzing image properties for the Foodpics image database

Matlab code for image analysis for the Foodpics image database. Run the script ``image_analysis.m`` to replicate the analysis of image properties published in:

*Blechert, J., Meule, A., Busch, N. A., & Ohla, K. (2014). Food-pics: an image database for experimental research on eating and appetite. Frontiers in Psychology, 5, 617.*

This script assumes that you have downloaded the image files from the Foodpics website:

<http://www.eat.sbg.ac.at/resources/food-pics>

The code was tested under Matlab R2014a.
